# Local-Group-Members-Enumeration-Script
This PowerShell script enumerates the members of local groups on a Windows machine using ADSI (Active Directory Service Interfaces). It reads a list of local groups from a file, retrieves the members of each group, prints the results to the console, and saves them to an output file.
